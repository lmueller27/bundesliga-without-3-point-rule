# What would the past Bundesliga seasons have looked like if the three-point-per-win rule had never been introduced?

In this notebook we recalculate the final standings of the Bundesliga seasons 95/96 - 22/23. Instead of the three points per win, that were introduced before the 95/96 season, we calculate the tables using the previously used 2 points per win. 

Of course, this completely neglects all kinds of factors like different tactics and psychological effects based on different standings during the season. It's just a bit of "what if?" fun. üôÇ‚öΩÔ∏è

The tables below show the alternate final standings with the alternate 2-rule point sums in the "points-2" columnn and the difference in final position of each team shown in the "diff" column.

There are two "robbed" Meisterschalen and some relegations that could have been prevented. There is also a season in which it would not have made a difference. In general, you can see that especially lower-table teams that earned lots of (probably hard fought) draws are at a disadvantage with the 3-point-rule. 


The dataset used for the 95/96 to 08/09 seasons was taken from [here](https://github.com/thomascamminady/AllBundesligaGamesEver). The later seasons are fetched from here: https://openligadb.de/
